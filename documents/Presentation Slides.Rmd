# Urban Forest

## UF: Our Work

- There's a lot of literature about trees and demographics, because Portland has such well documented data on the street trees

- Using ggmap and shiny, we can interactively really dig into that data




## UF: The Narrative

- By using a shiny app as our deliverable, we don't have to necessarily choose which narrative we're trying to present

- We can guide people towards a narrative, but ultimately the choice is up to them!


## UF: The Implications

- We want to have data tables and regressions: some way to make implications out of the data

- This will be difficult! But we're working on it


## UF: The Question

- This begs the question: what questions are we asking ourselves?
