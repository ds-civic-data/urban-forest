## Themes
Trees! We're going to look at trees and what effect they have on house prices, using the literature as a guide. We will expand our analysis to include census data, examining demographics in portland in relation to the trees.

## Questions
Do trees affect housing prices in neighborhoods? How does this vary by neighborhood? How can we best visualize this? How does this interact with census data, with demographics and household sizes.

## Data

### Sources

Data will mostly come from the USDA forestry data, as well as some Portland neighborhood guidelines and tree rules.

City of Portland - Parks & Recreation: https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/433143


### Data structure
Observational unit, vairables, confidentiality


## Deliverable
We will be making a Shiny App, which will visualize spatially the distribution of trees across Portland metro by tree type, and this can be overlaid with various demographic information, and infrastructural information like bike paths, major roadways, etc.
